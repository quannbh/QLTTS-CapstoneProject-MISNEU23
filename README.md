# Intern Management Application (KMPG Audit Company)

Welcome to the Intern Management Application, a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and enhance the process of managing interns within your organization. This application is crafted with efficiency in mind, aiming to simplify the complexities associated with intern onboarding, task assignment, progress tracking, and overall communication.

## Introduction

My team **KANJI AI Research Lab** and me **(kanjiroquanngo)** built this project according to the customer's request. This project is allowed to become open source and can become a useful reference source for programmers who want to build a human resource management / student management application... for their business. Especially useful for .NET developers who do not want to use Winform but are looking for a new platform with more aesthetics and better customization according to their requirements, which is Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The project is completely public only on the Github platform and we will continuously improve upgrades in the future.


## TechStack

**Client:** XAML (WPF)

**Server:** .NET Framework 4.7.2 (C#)
